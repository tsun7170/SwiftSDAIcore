/// The SDAIDictionarySchema defines the structure of a data dictionary that makes available information about the EXPRESS schemas that describe the instances operated on in an SDAI session.
/// The structure of the SDAIDictionarySchema reflects the structure of EXPRESS itself.
/// Not all items that may be defined using EXPRESS appear in the SDAIDictionarySchema as some kinds of items are not required to define the SDAI operations.
/// Mapping EXPRESS schemas into a population of the SDAIDictionarySchema is described in annex A.
