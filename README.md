# SwiftSDAIcore
The runtime environment for the exp2swift translated EXPRESS codes.

by Tsutomu Yoshida, Minokamo Japan.

This package implements the runtime foundation functionalities required for the exp2swift translated ISO 10303 STEP schema files into the Swift programing language.
Specifically,
* all built-in data types, functions and procedures defined in ISO 10303-11 EXPRESS language.
* part of SDAI schemas defined in ISO 10303-22, of which make sense in the Swift environment for importing ISO 10303-21 exchange structure (modification and exporting of the STEP entities are out of scope).
* basic functionalities to import ISO 10303-21 exchange structure files.
